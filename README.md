### Project Summary:
Our team accessed the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s database to analyze 8 years of rail accidents across the United States. We utilized the full data science pipeline to analyze the data and create a classification model that would predict which company would be involved in a rail accident.


**Data Source:** U.S. Department of Transportation

### Project Goals:
- Determine which features are drivers of highway rail accidents and equipment rail accidents.
- Build a classification model for predicting which Railroad operator is most likely to be involved with a given accident.
- Showcase highlighted findings in a presentation with in-depth findings, analysis, and process well documented in a final, reproduciable report.
